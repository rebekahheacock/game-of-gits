House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

BUT NO. He's murdered. The end.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

Joffrey Baratheon is the absolute worst and everyone wants to punch him in the face,
which he totally deserves even if he is technically a 'child'

Luckily, Tyrion punches him in the face! Tyrion is the new hero of this story.
